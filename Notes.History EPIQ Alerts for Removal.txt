This is how to update "Filtering Table" used in the BI reports. 
- "Filtering Table" is a list of alerts removed from the reports
	- Needed bc when there are a large number of alerts to be filtered out, this is the most efficient way and can be updated
	with more in the future
	
1. Identify the alerts needed for removal 
	- OPP_ID + Created_Date (date + time needed)
2. Open Excel file = "History EPIQ Alerts for Removal"
3. Go to tab "Combined Alerts for Removal"
4. Make sure pasted OPP_ID has ' in front of each 
	- This forces excel to recognize the cell as TEXT
5. Make sure Created_Date has the format of DATE & TIME
	- The exact time is not needed but the format must be in DATE & TIME
6. Add to the running list that is currently there
7. Open any BI report that uses 'i2_data.dbo.PROFITECT_OPPORTUNITIES'
8. Open "Filtering Table" in Power Query
9. Add the new list of alerts + dates
10. Save and Launch
